<h1>Cotswalds Meets Mountaintop!</h1>

<h2>English manor elegance on 3+ manicured acres in Mountaintop Golf & Lake Club with storybook charm and mountain craftsmanship</h2>

<p>Say hello to your countryside escape in Mountaintop Golf & Lake Club, a one-of-a-kind estate designed by the acclaimed PLATT Architecture and inspired by the timeless charm of England's rolling countryside. This isn't just another mountain home. It's a place where stone pathways wind through English-style gardens, where every room feels like it was designed for the life you've always imagined, and where the crisp mountain air meets old-world elegance at every turn.</p>

<p class="image-caption">Winding stone paths lead through manicured gardens reminiscent of the English countryside</p>

<h2>English-Style Gardens with Mountain Soul</h2>

<p>Picture yourself wandering stone paths through manicured gardens that could have been lifted straight from the Cotswolds. This estate sits on 2½ Mountaintop lots totaling over 3 beautifully landscaped acres that feel like your own private park.</p>

<p>In spring, the gardens burst into bloom. Summer afternoons invite you to pour a glass of rosé on the terrace, where you might enjoy watching birds flit among the flowers. Come fall, the mountain air turns crisp and the surrounding hardwoods paint the landscape in amber and gold. Winter transforms the grounds into a peaceful retreat where wood smoke curls from the chimneys and every season tells a different story.</p>

<p>Refined yet relaxed, this estate blends everyday comfort with artful design, offering a truly elevated mountain living experience. Beyond the beautifully realized main residence, the vast outdoor space provides room to dream.</p>

<h3>A Canvas for Your Outdoor Vision</h3>

<p>Imagine adding a charming guest cottage where family can linger for long weekends, or creating an outdoor pavilion for summer evenings filled with laughter and good wine. With over three acres at your disposal, the possibilities are extensive.</p>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/2071-High-Mountain-Dr-Website-Collage-5.jpg" alt="Owner's wing terrace and gardens">

<h2>Dual Primary Suites for Generational Comfort</h2>

<p>Inside, you'll find 5 spacious bedrooms and 5.5 baths, including not one but two primary suites on the main level. This thoughtful design is perfect for multi-generational living, hosting pampered guests, or simply spreading out in style. Whether it's aging parents visiting for the holidays, adult children coming home with the grandkids in tow, or friends who've earned the VIP treatment, everyone gets their own private sanctuary.</p>

<p>The first primary suite is situated in the Owner's Wing and features a spa-like bathroom, cozy fireplace, wet bar, and a private walk-out stone terrace with its own gas log fireplace and Tennessee Fieldstone flooring. Imagine your morning coffee here as the mist lifts off Tom Fazio's acclaimed golf course, or an evening cocktail under the stars with nothing but the gentle rustle of mountain breeze and possibly the call of a barred owl breaking the silence.</p>

<h2>Gathering Spaces that Feel Grand Yet Inviting</h2>

<p>The great room is flooded with natural light, showcasing soaring ceilings, rich oak floors, and a dramatic floor-to-ceiling fireplace that anchors the space. This is where life unfolds naturally—game nights with the family sprawled on plush sofas, quiet mornings with a book and coffee by the fire, or holiday gatherings that spill from room to room as mulled wine simmers on the stove and laughter echoes off the high ceilings.</p>

<h2>Entertain Effortlessly, From Kitchen to Porch</h2>

<p>Central to the home, the kitchen is where everyone naturally gravitates. It connects both wings and features generous workspaces, an oversized center island perfect for rolling out pie dough or setting out a charcuterie board, walk-in pantry, dining area, SubZero refrigerator and freezer drawers, and even a gas fireplace for those chilly mountain mornings. This is a kitchen built for real life—whether that's Tuesday night pasta or hosting Thanksgiving for twenty.</p>

<p class="image-caption">The heart of the home features top-tier appliances and room for the whole family to gather</p>

<p>Adjacent to the kitchen, a wet bar makes entertaining feel effortless. Stock it with your favorite Burgundies, set out the good crystal, and let the evening unfold naturally.</p>

<h2>Mountain Mornings & Fireside Evenings</h2>

<p>The kitchen opens directly to the screened porch, and this might just become your favorite room in the house. With a stone fireplace, TV, and dining space, it's ideal for Saturday morning pancakes while watching golfers play Mountaintop's 1st hole, Sunday football with the game on and a fire crackling, or summer evenings of fireflies and the slowly setting sun. Rain or shine, spring through fall, this is where you'll want to be.</p>

<p class="image-caption">The screened porch offers comfortable views of Tom Fazio's masterfully designed opening hole</p>

<h2>Beauty Meets Utility: Spaces for Work & Real Life</h2>

<p>Work and study are thoughtfully addressed with a dedicated office featuring custom-built bookshelves—perfect for Zoom calls or catching up with the world on a rainy afternoon. And because real mountain life means muddy hiking boots and golf cleats, you'll appreciate the spacious mudroom complete with laundry area, wash sink, and ample storage. Everything has its place.</p>

<h2>Owner's Wing & Private Retreat</h2>

<p>The Owner's Wing is its own private sanctuary, complete with a cozy lounge featuring wet bar, big-screen TV, and surround sound, plus a second work area for when inspiration strikes. This is the kind of space where you close the door at the end of the day, pour a nightcap, sink into the sofa, and truly unwind.</p>

<p class="image-caption">Separate his and hers closets and bathrooms ensure everyone gets their own sanctuary</p>

<h2>Thoughtful Touches Throughout</h2>

<p>The Owner's Wing also features a private walk-out stone terrace with gas log fireplace and Tennessee Fieldstone flooring—your personal outdoor living room overlooking the golf course. Picture evening cocktails here as the last of the day's golfers finish their round.</p>

<p>Step into the bedroom and you'll find a peaceful retreat with a fireplace for those nights when the temperature drops and the mountain feels especially quiet and still.</p>

<h2>Spa-Like Sanctuaries</h2>

<p>The His and Hers bathrooms feel more like a five-star spa than a home, with heated marble floors (because stepping onto cold tile in January is simply not acceptable), soaking tubs, heated towel racks, and separate walk-in closets.</p>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/2071-High-Mountain-Dr-Website-Collage-17.jpg" alt="Guest bedroom hallway and closet">

<p>This is where you start and end your day feeling like you're perpetually on vacation.</p>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/2071-High-Mountain-Dr-Website-Collage-18.jpg" alt="Guest bathroom">

<h2>Thoughtful Spaces for Guests, Play & Work</h2>

<p>An elevator adds ease for guests of all ages, making everyday living (and guests' trips upstairs with luggage) that much more gracious.</p>

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/2071-High-Mountain-Dr-Website-Collage-19.jpg" alt="Elevator, closets, and upstairs systems">

<p>Travel upstairs to find three ensuite guest bedrooms, each with a private bathroom—no fighting over the shower schedule when the whole family descends for the holidays. Plus, a bonus room serves as the perfect flex space for a playroom where grandkids can spread out their toys, a home gym, or a second office.</p>

<h2>Top-Tier Systems, Timeless Materials</h2>

<p>Beyond the gorgeous design and thoughtful layout, this estate is equipped with the features you'd expect in a home of this caliber. A full lightning protection system (because mountain storms are spectacular but serious), exterior landscape lighting that makes the gardens glow at twilight, and a whole-home generator for peace of mind year-round. Power outages happen up here, and yours could be an excuse to light candles and enjoy the romance of it all. But you could also use the generator.</p>

<p class="image-caption">Stone, copper gutters, and thoughtful architectural details ensure this estate will only grow more distinguished with time</p>

<p>The home is sound-wired with speakers throughout for your favorite jazz playlist or the morning news in every room. Hunter Douglas electric window treatments, plaster interior walls, and heated floors in the primary suites and kitchen speak to its enduring craftsmanship. The stone exterior, copper gutters, and garage with carport and golf cart bay complete the package, combining functionality with timeless curb appeal that will age beautifully over the decades.</p>

<h2>Outdoor Spaces that Feel Like a Private Estate</h2>

<p>What truly sets this property apart is what lies beyond the doors. Winding stone paths meander through manicured English-style gardens and peaceful wooded surroundings. The gently rolling 3+ acre lot offers room to add a guest cottage, or perhaps other outdoor features, while preserving your sense of privacy and space.</p>

<p> This isn't just a lot. It's a legacy property.</p>
