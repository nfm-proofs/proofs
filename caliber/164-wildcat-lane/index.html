<h1>New Construction Meets Move-in Ready Mountain Living!</h1>

<h2>Whiteside Mountain Views & Modern Convenience in Gated Foxfire: Five Bedrooms, Including a Garage Apartment</h2>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-1.jpg" /></p>

<p>A brand-new 5 bedroom, 5 bathroom home in the gated Foxfire community that checks all the boxes: privacy, Whiteside Mountain views, and a central location where Cashiers & Highlands are within easy reach.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-2.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Where Privacy and Proximity Coexist</h2>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-3.jpg" /></p>

<p>This well-executed home is set on a generous 1.5+ acre homesite providing room to spread out and savor “mountain time” like never before!</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-4.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Thoughtful Design & Light-Filled Spaces</h2>

<p>The open layout is inviting the second you walk in the door.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-5.jpg" /></p>

<p>Throughout the home, walls of windows let in tons of light, pre-engineered hardwood floors span most rooms, stone countertops shine, and the color palette complements any design style.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-6.jpg" /></p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-8.jpg" /></p>

<p>Whether you're furnishing from scratch or bringing cherished pieces, the backdrop works.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-7.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Made for How People Actually Gather</h2>

<p>The main level delivers spaces people gravitate to, like the great room with a wood-burning fireplace and shiplap accent wall paired with endless flow into the dining area, wet bar, and kitchen.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-9.jpg" /></p>

<p>It's the kind of layout that makes hosting feel effortless, and when you're hosting, everything is exactly where it should be.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-10.jpg" /></p>

<p>Designed for entertaining, the kitchen has stainless steel appliances, a gas range, abundant storage, and direct access to a dry bar, mudroom, full bath, and pantry.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-11.jpg" /></p>

<p>Cook with mountain views as your backdrop, then step into the wet bar area when you need more counter space or a moment away from the action.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-12.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Indoor-Outdoor Living with Ease and Beauty</h2>

<p>The living areas extend to the covered deck, featuring a wood-burning fireplace, and an open porch overlooking the back lawn and mountains beyond.</p>

<p>You'll find yourself using these spaces year-round—the covered deck when you want the warmth of the fire, the open porch when you want nothing but fresh air and scenery.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-13.jpg" /></p>

<p>Come summer, you can't beat the open porch for taking in the full scope of the mountain views with nothing between you and the scenery.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-14.jpg" /></p>

<p>On cooler evenings, the covered deck with its fireplace becomes the preferred gathering spot. </p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-15.jpg" /></p>

<h2>The Junior Suite, on the Main Level</h2>

<p>The main level is also home to a Junior Owners' Suite with sliding glass doors to the open porch and an en-suite bathroom with oversized shower and double vanity.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-16.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Privacy on Its Own Level</h2>

<p>When you need separation from the rest of the house, you have it.</p>

<p>Up the floating stairs, you find the Primary Owners' Suite, which encompasses the entire upper level.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-17.jpg" /></p>

<p>With soaring ceilings overhead, the bedroom feels expansive while still maintaining its intimate character.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-18.jpg" /></p>

<p>It's a genuine spa-like retreat featuring a spacious bedroom, office, fitness room, and walk-in closet.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-19.jpg" /></p>

<p>The soaking tub sits directly beside a window framing mountain views—exactly where you want to be after a long day.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-20.jpg" /></p>

<p>There's also a hidden room tucked behind custom shelves that could make a perfect 2nd Owners' closet or workout room.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-21.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Guest Quarters That Feel Generous: Lower Level and Garage Apartment</h2>

<p>Guests are treated just as well downstairs in the large family room with a full wet bar.</p>

<p>The layout ensures everyone has their space, which tends to make visits more relaxed for everyone involved.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-22.jpg" /></p>

<p>This level also has two guest bedrooms, a full bathroom, and access to the covered patio leading to the lawn.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-23.jpg" /></p>

<p>The lower level handles the practical side well—storage for essentials, comfortable guest bedrooms, a family room to spread out in—and it opens directly to the patio and lawn, where you'll find yourself gathering around the firepit once the sun goes down.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-24.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Double Garage & Carriage House</h2>

<p>Above the double garage, a 5th bedroom suite and full bathroom are great for extended stays, making all your guests feel welcome to visit.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-25.jpg" /></p>

<h2>The Details That Matter Long-Term</h2>

<p>Other property features include a circular paved driveway, dual-fuel HVAC, Trex decking, and a 26kw generator. Peaceful yet convenient, the setting places you near an outstanding lineup of exclusive golf clubs, and the seller is offering a $75,000 credit for a club membership of your choice with an acceptable offer.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-26.jpg" /></p>

<h2>New, Private, and Available Now</h2>

<p>The benefits of new construction, mountain views, and privacy make this home a standout opportunity on the Highlands-Cashiers Plateau.</p>

<p><img alt="Exterior gardens and pathways" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.usmre.com/10727/164-wildcat-lane-website-collage-27.jpg" /></p>

<p>It's easy to live in, easier to love, and ready for you to enjoy, now!</p>
